    # @param [String] name The name of the shared example group to be wrapped.
    # @param [Array] args Optional array of arguments that are passed on to
    #   the shared example group.

    #   on to the shared example group.

    #   intended to modify the behavior of sibling examples. Wrapping the
    #   example group in a `describe` block breaks that relationship. Best
    #   practice is to use the `#wrap_examples` method to safely encapsulate
    #   example groups with side effects, and the `#fwrap_examples` method to
    #   automatically focus such groups.
